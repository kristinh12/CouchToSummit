Description

CouchToSummit is an app to help users reach their hiking and climbing goals in addition to being a searchable hike database.  Users can select a trail as their goal, as well as a date they would like to complete it by. In the goal dashboard, nearby hikes will be listed out in order of difficulty so that people can train for their hiking goal. Difficulty will take into account distance, elevation gain, and how steep each trail is. As they complete their training, they can log the details about their hike such as the amount of time it took, and how they felt. 

Since this is also a hike database, anyone can search the database for local hikes without having to create a user id.  It will display a map and details about the hike. Users can also leave reviews of hikes and add photos.
